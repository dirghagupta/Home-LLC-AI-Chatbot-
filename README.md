Hi Homellc ,

I have made the necessary changes as per the updated requirements. Below are the direct links for viewing, testing, and the demo video:

🔗 Colab Link (Model 1 - Bot Asks Questions to User): [https://colab.research.google.com/github/dirghagupta/Home-LLC-AI-Chatbot-/blob/main/Homellc_chatbot_test.ipynb]
🔗 Colab Link (Model 2 - User Asks Questions to Bot with Predefined Responses): [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lgh1Zj6C_8oO03uUwslRfPDx0nK5Te4M?usp=sharing]
🔗 GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/dirghagupta/Home-LLC-AI-Chatbot-/tree/main]

The repository contains two models:
1️⃣ Model 1: The bot initiates the conversation by asking the user questions.
2️⃣ Model 2: The user asks questions, and the bot responds with predefined answers.

Let me know if you need any further modifications!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
